## Skeliton Creation  
"You are my Senior Conversion Copywriter.

Goal  
Craft a first-draft homepage for [[YOUR BUSINESS NAME]], a business offering [[SERVICES HERE]], that:  
• Opens with a results-focused promise and positions the CLIENT—not the business—as the hero.  
• Speaks in the real words our ideal clients use.  
• Follows homepage best-practice layout proven for this industry.

Deep-Research Instructions  
1. *Industry best practices* – In the background, scan recent high-converting homepages for businesses like mine. List the elements, order, and tone that drive the most leads.  
2. *Voice of Customer (VoC)* – Mine public forums, Reddit threads, Quora, Google & Yelp reviews, Facebook groups, and blog comments where *[[IDEAL CLIENT TYPE]]* talk about:  
   • Their top problems and frustrations  
   • Their dream outcomes  
   • Exact phrases, metaphors, and questions they use  
3. *Competitive gap* – Note what most competitors over-emphasize (themselves) and under-emphasize (client results), then explain how we’ll flip that script.

Before you write  
Ask me any follow-up questions *one round only* to fill unavoidable gaps (e.g., unique mechanism, proof, service area, guarantees, simple testimonial snippets). Keep it to ≤ 5 quick questions.

Research Output (work silently—do *NOT* reveal raw URLs)  
• Bullet summary of industry homepage best practices  
• Top 10 VoC phrases grouped by theme (problem / desire)  
• 3-point competitive gap insight

Homepage Draft Requirements  
• Use the structure below (sections in CAPS).  
• Make every section speak to “you” (the client) and show how we guide them to the result.  
• Work at an 7th-grade reading level, clear and conversational.  
• Keep paragraphs 2-3 lines max.  
• Weave in at least 6 VoC phrases naturally.  
• Close with a single clear CTA button label: **[[CALL-TO-ACTION]]**.

Formatting Instructions:
• Each section should be separated by a line break.
• Do not include section labels like “hero,” “problem,” etc.
• The only label should be the actual client-facing headline for each section. Make sure it aligns 100% with the content that follows.
• For each section, give an image suggestion that helps tell the story visually. Keep the visual emphasis on the client.

STRUCTURE  
1. HERO HEADLINE – Big result in one line  
2. SUPPORTING SUBHEAD – Empathy + outcome in plain words (1-2 short sentences max)
3. CALL TO ACTION BUTTON - Indicative of what the next step actually is (not 'Contact Us', etc)    
4. PROBLEM SECTION – Bring up the main problem they have and agitate it with symptoms of how that problem affects their day to day life  
5. SOLUTION SECTION – Introduce the business/service as the ultimate solution that fixes it. Suggest an image of the business owner/team to build trust/rapport.  
6. 3 BENEFITS – Title each as the actual benefit, then allude to the feature that makes it possible in a short description. Give simple image suggestions for each.   
7. SOCIAL PROOF SECTION – logos or short testimonial snippets    
8. CTA BLOCK – Button + urgency/benefit line  
9. FAQ – 3 concise Q&As that remove last-minute doubts

Deliverables  
1. Two headline options  
2. Finished homepage copy following the structure above
